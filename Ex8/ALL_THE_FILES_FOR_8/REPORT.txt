1. ERRORS/WARNINGS 
	[Synth 8-85] always block has no event control specified ["/home/centos/CWM-ECAD/Ex8/top.v":49]

	[Synth 8-3331] design top has unconnected port rst_n

	[Constraints 18-5210] No constraints selected for write.
	Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is opened.

	[Project 1-478] Design 'synth_1' is stale and will not be used when launching 'impl_1'
